#Mobility Management  


Our robot is very lightweight, convenient and small. We made the robot small because when a robot is small it can be very fast and technical. We used sensors like ultrasonic sensor and gyroscope and color sensor. Each of them has their own responsibilities. For example: a gyroscope helps us keep 90â€¢ in movements. We made the speed very low so that he would not quickly lose track of his movements and see the wrists.

#Managing power and meaning.

We use a lot of sensors. But the most important of them are: Ultrasonic sensor and Gyroscope and Color sensor. Each of them has its own responsibilities. We chose these sensors because they are more suitable for this category. For example, an ultrasonic sensor helps us see curbs and move back a little and turn around. And the color sensor will help us during the 2nd round.
