#Mobility Management
Our robot is very lightweight, convenient and small. We made the robot small because when a robot is small it can be very fast and technical. We used sensors like ultrasonic sensor and gyroscope and color sensor. Each of them has their own responsibilities. For example: a gyroscope helps us keep 90â€¢ in movements. We made the speed very low so that he would not quickly lose track of his movements and see the wrists.
